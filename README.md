# User Management Backend API

A backend REST API built with **Fastify** (TypeScript), **Prisma**, and **PostgreSQL**, designed to be containerized with **Docker**. This service handles authentication, user management, and serves a Swagger-based API documentation.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the project

```bash
git clone git@github.com:amel-harrath/backend.git
cd backend
```

### 2. Setup Environment

Create a .env file:

```
DATABASE_URL=
PORT=
NODE_ENV=
APP_JWT_SECRET=
POSTGRES_USER=
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=
POSTGRES_DB=
HOST=
```

### 3. Start with Docker

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## 🧪 Running Locally (without Docker)

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Generate Prisma client

```bash
npm run db:gen
```

### 3. Run database migrations

```bash
npm run migrate:dev
```

### 4. Seed the database

```bash
npm run seed
```

### 5. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🧱 Future Enhancements

1. **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:  
   In the future, we can add roles to the users (e.g., Admin, User, Moderator) and manage access rights based on these roles. This would involve extending the backend API to handle roles for each user, ensuring that only authorized users have access to certain routes or functionalities.

2. **User Permissions Management**:  
   Along with roles, we can consider implementing user permissions to fine-tune which actions a user can perform (e.g., view only, create, update, delete). This would be helpful to create a more robust system that controls access to different parts of the application.

3. **Session Management**:  
   Currently, the app relies on JWT tokens for authentication. We can consider implementing features like token refresh or session expiration handling for better security and usability.

4. **Extend API**:  
   Future improvements could involve adding more CRUD operations on other resources or integrating external services into the application (e.g., email notifications, file uploads, etc.).

5. **Testing**:  
   Add unit and integration tests using libraries like [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/). This will ensure that the app is robust and maintains high quality through future updates.
